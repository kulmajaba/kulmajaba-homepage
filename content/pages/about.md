This site was born from the frustration for disposable tiny screen content and shitposting on social media. I decided to carve out a little corner for myself where you can take a breather, explore at your own pace, then leave and come back when you feel like it. Frankly, I'm not sure when I'll come back and update this either. It'll happen. Probably.

## The creator

My name is Mika. Too many interests, too little time is my life in a nutshell. Among other things I do photography and sometimes I mix it with my other interests.

If you want to buy something you saw on the site, reach out to \<email\> and we'll figure it out. I don't usually sell my works but it can be arranged.
